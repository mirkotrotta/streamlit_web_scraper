## üõ† How to Use

### Scraping a Website
1. **Enter the URL** of the website you want to scrape.
2. **Select if the website is dynamic** (i.e., JavaScript-heavy) or static.
3. **Click "Scrape Website"**: The scraper will retrieve text-based content from the site, organizing it by page and section into a Markdown file.
4. **Download the Markdown file**: Once the scrape is complete, download the file directly through the interface or access previously saved scrapes.

### Features in Progress
- **Slack Integration**: Soon, you'll be able to send scraped data to a specified Slack channel.
- **More Framework Support**: Future experiments include integrating with additional frameworks and APIs for advanced scraping scenarios.

## üîÑ Roadmap

### Planned Features
- **Slack Integration**: Scrape data and automatically send it to a Slack channel for quick collaboration.
- **API Integration**: Adding support for scraping APIs and handling authentication where required.
- **Advanced Scraping Techniques**: Experimenting with frameworks like Playwright for even better dynamic content handling.
